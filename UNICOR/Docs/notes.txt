Hey Ms. Class Clown ;)  If you have time off from your busy schedule, I'm actually in Vegas for the week. I'm NOT looking to "hook up"! I took the trip on short notice so I didn't get a chance to invite anyone, which is kinda lame since everyone is here with someone to joke with. Anyway, if you're interested in drinks, maybe some gambling (?), or whatever else there is to do in Vegas (I honestly need to explorer), let me know! And if I'm being honest, I thought you looked cute and fun in your pics (like an actual 'nice' person), so I figured I'd ask. 

Cheers,
Jonathan
